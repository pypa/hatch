# How to authenticate for index publishing

----

To publish to a package index such as PyPI or TestPyPI you need two things:

1. a username (e.g. `__token__` for PyPI)
2. a token value or other form of trusted authentication from the index (PyPI)


!!! warning "PyPI requires 2FA"
    PyPI now requires 2-factor Authentication (2FA) for all publication processes. Be sure to set this up before proceeding with publishing your package to TestPyPI or PyPI.

## Storing your PyPI credentials 

You can chose to either enter your username when using `hatch publish` or you can store it.

Your PyPI username is derived from the following sources, in order of precedence:

1. The  `--user` / `-u` cli option. e.g. `hatch publish -u __token__`
2. The `HATCH_INDEX_USER` environment variable.
3. The [`repos` tables](../../plugins/publisher/package-index.md).
4. The [`~/.pypirc` file](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pypirc/) which is also the default file used by Twine to publish to PyPI.
5. The input to an interactive prompt.

If you don't provide a username, the value `__token__` is used by default.

### Password / credentials

Your password or credential value is looked up in the following places and in this order of precedence:

1. The [`~/.pypirc` file](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pypirc/)
   if the username was provided by it.
2. The `--auth` / `-a` cli option.
3. The `HATCH_INDEX_AUTH` environment variable.
4. The [`repos` tables](../../plugins/publisher/package-index.md).
5. A variety of OS-level credentials services backed by [keyring](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring).
6. The input to an interactive prompt.

If you input your password and/or username into the interactive prompt when using `hatch publish`, then Hatch will store those credentials in
[Hatch's cache](../../config/hatch.md#cache). Your password stored in an available
[keyring](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring) backed credentials stores.

!!! note "Keyring storage"
    By default Hatch tries to store your authentication credentials in a keyring application. For the time being, this means that you may run into issues using Hatch Publish in a controlled environment such as GitHub codespaces. In this case, you may want to use Twine to publish. 

## Use trusted publisher workflows for automated publishing
 
If you wish to automate your release workflow, we recommend that you use PyPI's ["Trusted Publishing" with OIDC](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/). A GitHub Action supporting this workflow can be found 
[`here: pypi-publish`](https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish). 

While trusted publish approach is preferred, you can also use per-project [API tokens](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken).
