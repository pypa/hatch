-----

All notable changes to Hatch will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

***Changed:***

- The `run`/`env run`, `fmt` and `shell` commands now only change the current working directory to the project root if not already inside the project
- The `shell` command now accepts a single argument to specify the environment to enter which overrides the standard choice mechanisms. The arguments determining shell options have been converted to flags.

***Added:***

- Add `test` command
- The `run` command can now execute scripts that define inline metadata for dependencies and Python version constraints
- The `virtual` environment type now supports the ability to use UV in place of pip & virtualenv
- Add `self report` command for submitting pre-populated bug reports to GitHub
- The reserved environment used for static analysis is now completely configurable
- Add the following methods to the `environment` interface for complete control over output during life cycle management: `app_status_creation`, `app_status_pre_installation`, `app_status_post_installation`, `app_status_project_installation`, `app_status_dependency_state_check`, `app_status_dependency_installation_check`, `app_status_dependency_synchronization`
- Add binaries for 32-bit versions of Windows
- Read configuration from any `~/.pypirc` file for the `index` publisher
- Use the Git user as the default username for new project URL metadata
- Add `HATCH_DEBUG` environment variable that when enabled will show local variables in the case of unhandled tracebacks
- Upgrade default CPython distributions to 20240415
- Upgrade default PyPy distributions to 7.3.15
- Upgrade Ruff to 0.4.1
- Upgrade PyApp to 0.18.0 for binary builds
- Bump the minimum supported version of Hatchling to 1.24.2

***Fixed:***

- Maintain consistent data paths for case insensitive file systems
- When projects derive dependencies from metadata hooks, there is now by default a status indicator for when the hooks are executed for better responsiveness
- Properly support projects with a `pyproject.toml` file but no `project` table e.g. applications
- Fix the `fmt` command when automatically installing plugin dependencies
- Fix dependency inheritance for the template of the `types` environment for new projects
- Fix warnings related to tar file extraction on Python 3.12+ when unpacking Python distributions for installation
- De-select Ruff rule `E501` for the `fmt` command by default since it conflicts with the formatter
- Fix colored output from build targets on the first run (build environment creation status indicator issue)
- Set the `packaging` dependency version as `>=23.2` to avoid its URL validation which can conflict with context formatting
- Fix the exit code when there happens to be an unhandled exception
- No longer capture both stdout and stderr streams when parsing metadata payloads from build environments
