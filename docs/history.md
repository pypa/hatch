### Unreleased

***Added:***

- Update project metadata to reflect support for Python 3.11

***Changed:***

- In order to simplify the implementation of command execution for environment plugins, the `run_shell_commands` method has been replaced by the singular `run_shell_command`. A new `command_context` method has been added to more easily satisfy complex use cases.
- The `finalize_command` environment plugin method has been removed in favor of the newly introduced context formatting functionality.

***Added:***

- Add context formatting functionality i.e. the ability to insert values into configuration like environment variables and command line arguments
- Any verbosity for command execution will now always display headers, even for single environments
- Every executed command is now displayed when running multiple commands or when verbosity is enabled
- Similar to `make`, ignore the exit code of executed commands that start with `-` (a hyphen)
- Add ability for the `--init` flag of the `new` command to automatically migrate `setuptools` configuration
- Update project metadata to reflect the adoption by PyPA and production stability
