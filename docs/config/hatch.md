# Hatch configuration

-----

Configuration for Hatch itself is stored in a `config.toml` file located by default in one of the following platform-specific directories.

| Platform | Path |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Preferences/hatch` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\hatch` |
| Unix | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hatch` (the [XDG_CONFIG_HOME](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html#variables) environment variable default is `~/.config`) |

You can select a custom path to the file using the `--config` [root option](../cli/reference.md#hatch) or by setting the `HATCH_CONFIG` environment variable.

The file can be managed by the [`config`](../cli/reference.md#hatch-config) command group.

## Mode

The `mode` key controls how Hatch selects the project to work on.

### Local

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: config.toml"

    ```toml
    mode = "local"
    ```

By default, Hatch will look for a `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` file in the current working directory
and any parent directories. The directory storing the first found file will be considered the project root.

### Project

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: config.toml"

    ```toml
    mode = "project"
    project = "proj1"

    [projects]
    proj1 = "/path/to/project1"
    proj2 = {"location": "/path/to/project2"}

    [dirs]
    project = ["/path/to/monorepo1", "/path/to/monorepo2"]
    ```

In this mode, Hatch will only work on the selected `project`. The project is located using multiple heuristics:

1. If the project is defined in the `projects` table then it must be a string, or an inline table with a `location` key, that is the full path to the project.
2. If the project matches a subdirectory in any of the directories listed in `dirs.project`, then that will be used as the project root.

An error will occur if the project cannot be found.

You can use the [`config set`](../cli/reference.md#hatch-config-set) command to change the project you are working on:

```console
$ hatch config set project proj2
New setting:
project = "proj2"
```

The project can be selected on a per-command basis with the `-p`/`--project` (environment variable `HATCH_PROJECT`) [root option](../cli/reference.md#hatch).

### Aware

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: config.toml"

    ```toml
    mode = "aware"
    ```

This is essentially the `local` mode with a fallback to the `project` mode.

## Shell

You can control the shell used to [enter environments](../environment.md#entering-environments) with the `shell` key.

If defined as a string, it must be the name of one of the [supported shells](#supported) and be available along your `PATH`.

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: config.toml"

    ```toml
    shell = "fish"
    ```

If the executable name of your shell differs from the supported name, you can define the `shell` as a table with `name` and `path` keys.

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: config.toml"

    ```toml
    [shell]
    name = "powershell"
    path = "pwsh"
    ```

On non-Windows systems, you can change the default arguments used to spawn most shells with the `args` key. The default for such supported shells is usually `["-i"]`.

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: config.toml"

    ```toml
    [shell]
    name = "bash"
    args = ["--login"]
    ```

### Supported

| Shell | Name | Arguments | macOS | Windows | Unix |

| [tcsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcsh) | `tcsh` | `["-i"]` | :white_check_mark: | | :white_check_mark: |
| [xonsh](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh) | `xonsh` | | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| [Z shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) | `zsh` | `["-i"]` | :white_check_mark: | | :white_check_mark: |

### Default

On Windows systems Hatch will use the `SHELL` environment variable, if present, followed by the `COMSPEC` environment variable, defaulting to `cmd`.
On all other platforms only the `SHELL` environment variable will be used, defaulting to `bash`.

## Directories

### Data

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: config.toml"

    ```toml
    [dirs]
    data = "..."
    ```

This is the directory that is used to persist data. By default it is set to one of the following platform-specific directories.

| Platform | Path |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/hatch` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\hatch` |
| Unix | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/hatch` (the [XDG_DATA_HOME](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html#variables) environment variable default is `~/.local/share`) |

You can select a custom path to the directory using the `--data-dir` [root option](../cli/reference.md#hatch) or by setting the `HATCH_DATA_DIR` environment variable.

### Cache

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: config.toml"

    ```toml
    [dirs]
    cache = "..."
    ```

This is the directory that is used to cache data. By default it is set to one of the following platform-specific directories.

| Platform | Path |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Caches/hatch` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\hatch\Cache` |
| Unix | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/hatch` (the [XDG_CACHE_HOME](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html#variables) environment variable default is `~/.cache`) |

You can select a custom path to the directory using the `--cache-dir` [root option](../cli/reference.md#hatch) or by setting the `HATCH_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

### Environments

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: config.toml"

    ```toml
    [dirs.env]
    <ENV_TYPE> = "..."
    ```

This determines where to store environments, with every key being the [type of environment](environment.md#type) and the value being the desired storage location.

For example, if you wanted to store [virtual environments](../plugins/environment.md#virtual) in a `.virtualenvs` directory within your home directory, you could specify the following:

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: config.toml"

    ```toml
    [dirs.env]
    virtual = "~/.virtualenvs"
    ```

Any environment variables are also expanded. If the path is not absolute, then it will be relative to the project root.

Any type of environment that is not explicitly defined will default to `<DATA_DIR>/env/<ENV_TYPE>`.

### Python installations

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: config.toml"

    ```toml
    [dirs]
    python = "..."
    ```

This determines where to install specific versions of Python, with the full path being `<VALUE>/pythons`.

The following values have special meanings.

| Value | Path |
| --- | --- |
| `isolated` (default) | `<DATA_DIR>/pythons` |
| `shared` | `~/.pythons` |

## Terminal

You can configure how all output is displayed using the `terminal.styles` table. These settings are also applied to all plugins.

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: config.toml"

    ```toml
    [terminal.styles]
    error = "..."
    ...
    ```

Cross-platform terminal capabilities are provided by [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).

### Output levels

The levels of output are as follows. Note that the [verbosity](../cli/about.md) indicates the minimum level at which the output is displayed.

| Level | Default | Verbosity | Description |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `debug` | `bold` | 1 - 3 | Messages that are not useful for most user experiences |
| `error` | `bold red` | -2 | Messages indicating some unrecoverable error |
| `info` | `bold` | 0 | Messages conveying basic information |
| `success` | `bold cyan` | 0 | Messages indicating some positive outcome |
| `waiting` | `bold magenta` | 0 | Messages shown before potentially time consuming operations |
| `warning` | `bold yellow` | -1 | Messages conveying important information |

See the [documentation](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style.html) and [color reference](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appendix/colors.html) for guidance on valid values.

### Spinner

You can select the [sequence](https://github.com/Textualize/rich/blob/master/rich/_spinners.py) used for waiting animations with the `spinner` option.

=== ":octicons-file-code-16: config.toml"

    ```toml
    [terminal.styles]
    spinner = "..."
    ```
