# Wheel builder

-----

A [wheel](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/binary-distribution-format/) is a binary distribution of a Python package that can be installed directly into an environment.

## Configuration

The builder plugin name is `wheel`.

```toml config-example
[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
```

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `core-metadata-version` | `"2.3"` | The version of [core metadata](https://packaging.python.org/specifications/core-metadata/) to use |
| `shared-data` | | A mapping similar to the [forced inclusion](../../config/build.md#forced-inclusion) option corresponding to the `data` subdirectory within the standard [data directory](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/#the-data-directory) that will be installed globally in a given Python environment, usually under `#!python sys.prefix` |
| `shared-scripts` | | A mapping similar to the [forced inclusion](../../config/build.md#forced-inclusion) option corresponding to the `scripts` subdirectory within the standard [data directory](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/#the-data-directory) that will be installed in a given Python environment, usually under `Scripts` on Windows or `bin` otherwise, and would normally be available on PATH |
| `extra-metadata` | | A mapping similar to the [forced inclusion](../../config/build.md#forced-inclusion) option corresponding to extra [metadata](https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/#the-dist-info-directory) that will be shipped in a directory named `extra_metadata` |
| `strict-naming` | `true` | Whether or not file names should contain the normalized version of the project name |
| `macos-max-compat` | `true` | Whether or not on macOS, when build hooks have set the `infer_tag` [build data](#build-data), the wheel name should signal broad support rather than specific versions for newer SDK versions.<br><br>Note: The default will become `false`, and this option eventually removed, sometime after consumers like pip start supporting these newer SDK versions. |
| `bypass-selection` | `false` | Whether or not to suppress the error when one has not defined any file selection options and all heuristics have failed to determine what to ship |

## Versions

| Version | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `standard` (default) | The latest standardized format |
| `editable` | A wheel that only ships `.pth` files or import hooks for real-time development |

## Default file selection

When the user has not set any [file selection](../../config/build.md#file-selection) options, the [project name](../../config/metadata.md#name) will be used to determine the package to ship in the following heuristic order:

1. `<NAME>/__init__.py`
2. `src/<NAME>/__init__.py`
3. `<NAME>.py`
4. `<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/__init__.py`

If none of these heuristics are satisfied, an error will be raised.

## Reproducibility

[Reproducible builds](../../config/build.md#reproducible-builds) are supported.

## Build data

This is data that can be modified by [build hooks](../build-hook/reference.md).

| Data | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tag` | | The full [tag](https://peps.python.org/pep-0425/) part of the filename (e.g. `py3-none-any`), defaulting to a cross-platform wheel with the supported major versions of Python based on [project metadata](../../config/metadata.md#python-support) |
| `infer_tag` | `#!python False` | When `tag` is not set, this may be enabled to use the one most specific to the platform, Python interpreter, and ABI |
| `pure_python` | `#!python True` | Whether or not to write metadata indicating that the package does not contain any platform-specific files |
| `dependencies` | | Extra [project dependencies](../../config/metadata.md#required) |
| `shared_data` | | Additional [`shared-data`](#options) entries, which take precedence in case of conflicts |
| `shared_scripts` | | Additional [`shared-scripts`](#options) entries, which take precedence in case of conflicts |
| `extra_metadata` | | Additional [`extra-metadata`](#options) entries, which take precedence in case of conflicts |
| `force_include_editable` | | Similar to the [`force_include` option](../build-hook/reference.md#build-data) but specifically for the `editable` [version](#versions) and takes precedence |
