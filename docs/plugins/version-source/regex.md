Setting the version is supported.

source = "regex"
```

## Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `path` (required) | A relative path to a file containing the project's version |
| `pattern` | A regular expression that has a named group called `version` that represents the version. The default pattern looks for a variable named `__version__` or `VERSION` that is set to a string containing the version, optionally prefixed with the lowercase letter `v`. |
